libics MATLAB interface
=======================

This directory contains the sources for MATLAB MEX-files
that use libics to read and write ICS files. They serve
as examples on how to use libics, but are also useful for
people that use MATLAB and want to add ICS support.

The code in this directory falls under the same licence
terms as libics itself.

This code is currently not supported by Scientific Volume Imaging.

USAGE
=====

The two MEX-files are used in this way:

-------------------------------------------------------------
ICSREAD   Reads a numeric array from an ICS file.
    A = ICSREAD(FILENAME) reads the numeric data in
    an ICS image file named FILENAME into A.

    Known limitations:
       - Complex data is not read.
-------------------------------------------------------------
ICSWRITE   Writes a numeric array to an ICS file.
    ICSWRITE(A,FILENAME,COMPRESS) writes the numeric data
    in A to an ICS image file named FILENAME. If COMPRESS
    is non-zero the data will be written compressed.

    Known limitations:
       - Complex data is not written.
-------------------------------------------------------------


COMPILING
=========

If your version of MATLAB is 7.2 or older, uncomment the line at
the top of both source files that defines `mwSize`.

- UNIX or macOS:
Within MATLAB, type
  mex -I<icspath> icsread.c <icspath>/libics.a -lz
  mex -I<icspath> icswrite.c <icspath>/libics.a -lz
from the directory containing both source files. If the Zlib library is not in a standard location, you will have
to specify it explicitly, replace `-lz` with `<zlibpath>/libz.a`.

- Windows:
Within MATLAB, type:
  mex -I<icspath> -DWIN32 icsread.c <icspath>\libics.lib <zpath>\libz.lib
  mex -I<icspath> -DWIN32 icswrite.c <icspath>\libics.lib <zpath>\libz.lib
from the directory containing both source files. If you compiled
the dynamic version of libics (DLL) you should type this instead:
  mex -I<icspath> -DWIN32 -DUSE_ICSLIB_DLL icsread.c <icspath>\libics.lib <zpath>\libz.lib
  mex -I<icspath> -DWIN32 -DUSE_ICSLIB_DLL icswrite.c <icspath>\libics.lib <zpath>\libz.lib
Finally, if you used MinGW or Cygwin under Windows to compile libics,
you can use Gnumex (http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/) to configure your
MEX script correctly.

Alternatively, use the makefile from the system's prompt. The
provided makefile is written for both Borland BCC and Microsoft
Visual C++ (under Windows), but should be easy to adapt to another
system/compiler. Note that you need to configure MEX before running
the makefile.
